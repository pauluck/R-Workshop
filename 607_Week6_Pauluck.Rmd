<span style="color:blue">**We will analyze the following chart to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines: _Alaska_ and _AM West_.**</span><br>

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
```




```{r, collapse=TRUE}
# Read the csv file 
airline <- read.csv(file = "airline_arrivals.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
kable(airline)

# Make table from wide to long and get delayed rows
airline_delayed <- airline %>%
  gather("ArrivalCity", "Flights", 3:7) %>%
  arrange(Airline) %>%
  filter(ArrivalStatus == "delayed") %>%
  select(Airline, ArrivalCity, Flights)


# Get on time rows for percentage calculations
airline_ontime<- airline %>%
  gather("ArrivalCity", "Flights", 3:7) %>%
  arrange(Airline) %>%
  filter(ArrivalStatus == "on time") %>%
  select(Airline, ArrivalCity, Flights)

# Add DelayRate column
airline_delayed["DelayRate"] <- round(airline_delayed$Flights / (airline_delayed$Flights+airline_ontime$Flights),2)
kable(airline_delayed)

# Plot airlines by number of delays
p <- ggplot(airline_delayed, aes(fill=Airline, x=ArrivalCity, y=Flights))
p + geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity") + labs(title = "Delay in Numbers")

```

<span style="color:blue">**From looking at number of delays chart above, it appears AM West has more delays than Alaska 80% (4/5) of the time.  Phoenix being the number one and that is because more flights land there than Alaska airlines.**</span><br>


```{r}
# Plot airlines by percentage of delays
p2 <- ggplot(airline_delayed, aes(fill=Airline, x=ArrivalCity, y=DelayRate))
p2 + geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set2") + labs(title = "Delay in Percentages")

```

<span style="color:blue">**Looking at the rate of delays in both airlines, again AM West has more delays, however this time it is at all destinations, including Seattle!**</span><br>
